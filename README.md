A 2 player game where the first player to score 3 points wins.
Use your Hammer to hit the sensore to change your Orange lights brightness.
Match your organge light's brightness with the brightness of the light in the center to score a point.
There is a 1 second delay (on both players sides) after ever hit, so time your hits accordingly.
Once a player wins, the lights will fade 3 times, all lights will light up, and then the game will restart.
